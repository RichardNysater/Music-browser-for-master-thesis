    <h3>Reference list of the perceptual features</h3>
    <p>Some perceptual features may require musical knowledge to understand, these are listed as complex features.</p>
    <h4>Simple features</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Activity (low-high)</b><br>
        The activity of the music.
      </li>
      <li><b>Valence (negative-positive)</b><br>
        The emotion of the song, which ranges from negative to positive. A sad song would have a negative valence, and
        a
        happy song would have a positive valence.
      </li>
      <li><b>Speed (slow-fast)</b><br>
        The speed of the music, based on how fast the music feels.
      </li>
      <li><b>Modality (minor-major)</b><br>
        The modality of the song on a continuous scale from minor to major. In general (for western music), a song in
        minor will sound darker or softer than a song in major.
      </li>
      <li><b>Articulation (legato-staccato)</b><br>
        The duration of tones, measured from legato (longest) to staccato (shortest). See <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQZp2SqHR4I">this youtube video</a> for a quick explanation and
        example of
        staccato and legato.
      </li>
      <li><b>Dynamics (soft-loud)</b><br>
        The overall dynamic level of the music, disregarding the listening volume. Dynamics is related to how loud a musical piece feels.
      </li>
      <li><b>Pitch (low-high)</b><br>
        The general pitch height of the music. Pitch is what makes a sound "high" or "low". See <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wIOip2EVow&t=0m2s">this youtube video</a> for a short example.
      </li>
      <li><b>Dissonance (consonant-dissonant)</b><br>
        The dissonance of the music. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Ph0sa0Gc0">this youtube video</a>
        for
        a short demonstration of consonance vs dissonance.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Complex features</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Harmonic Complexity (simple-complex)</b><br>
        The complexity of the harmonic progression in the song. It intends to reflect things like the amount of chords changes or deviations from a key scale structure.
      </li>
      <li><b>Rhythmic Clarity (flowing-firm)</b><br>
        The amount of rhythmic accentuation of the music.
      </li>
      <li><b>Rhythmic Complexity (simple-complex)</b><br>
        A companion to the rhythmic clarity which measures the complexity of the rhythmic patterns.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to this music discovery service. The goal of this website is to evaluate the generation of
      playlists for users by utilizing a special type of features called perceptual features.</p>

    <p>For this prototype, only a set of 98 K-pop (korean pop) songs are used, so you will (probably) not find any
      songs
      you recognize.</p>

    <p>Please try out the three different sections of this website and then leave feedback in the feedback section.
      You don't have to answer all the questions, although the more you answer the more you help!</p>

    <p>For more information about the perceptual features see the Info tab.</p>

    <p>Below is a short description of each of the three available playlist generation tools and how to use them.</p>

    <h3>Emotions</h3>
    <p>This page features a square with four emotions in each corner. You can click anywhere within this square to
      generate a playlist which corresponds to the distance to the four emotions.</p>

    <p>For example, if you click close to the Happy corner, the website will try to generate happy songs.
      If you click between Happy and Aggressive, the website will try to generate songs which are both Happy and
      Aggressive.</p>

    <h3>Plane</h3>
    <p>This page features a square which represents a 2d graph. You choose one perceptual feature as the X-axis (the
      horizontal axis) and one perceptual feature as the Y-axis (the vertical axis).</p>
    <p>You can then click anywhere inside the graph and the website will generate a playlist with songs which match
      your
      selection.</p>
    <p>You can also choose the size of your selection marker (the circle which appears when you click) by changing the
      variance in the variance slider.</p>

    <h3>Sliders</h3>
    <p>In this page you can freely decide the ranges of any perceptual feature you want by moving the sliders.</p>

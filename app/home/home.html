    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This website is created to evaluate the generation of playlists by using <i>perceptual features</i>.
      Perceptual features are a type of musical features created with human perception in mind. Speed and articulation are two examples of such features.</p>

    <p>Try out the three different methods of generating playlists on this website by visiting the different sections in the top left. When you feel like you have experimented enough, please answer the questions in the feedback section.</p>

    <p>This evaluation only uses a set of 98 K-pop (Korean pop) songs,
      so you will (probably) not hear any songs you recognize.</p>

    <p>The <i>Info</i> tab in the top right explains the perceptual features.
      This information is especially helpful when using the Plane and Sliders sections.</p>

    <p>Below is a short description of each of the three available playlist generation tools and how to use them.</p>

    <h3>Emotions</h3>
    <p>This section has a box with four emotions in each corner.
      You can click anywhere within this box to generate a playlist which tries to match songs to how close you clicked to any emotion.</p>

    <p>For example, if you click close to the Happy corner, the website will try to generate happy songs.
      If you click between Happy and Aggressive, the website will try to generate songs which are both Happy and
      Aggressive.</p>

    <h3>Plane</h3>
    <p>This page has a box which represents a 2d graph.
      You choose one perceptual feature as the X-axis (the horizontal axis) and one perceptual feature as the Y-axis (the vertical axis).</p>
    <p>You can then click anywhere inside the graph and the website will generate a playlist with songs which match
      your selection.</p>

    <p>
      For example, if you select Speed and Modality you can search for fast songs with a minor modality (which should sound fast and dark),
      or slow songs with major modality etc.
    </p>

    <p>You can also choose the size of your selection marker (the circle which appears when you click) by changing the
      variance in the variance slider. The bigger the selection marker, the more songs you can find. </p>

    <h3>Sliders</h3>
    <p>On this page you can freely decide the range (0-100) of any perceptual feature you want by moving the sliders.
      The songs in your playlist will then be between those values.</p>
    <br>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to this music discovery evaluation.
      This website is created to evaluate the generation of playlists by using something called <i>perceptual features</i>.
      Perceptual features are a type of musical features designed to be aligned with human perception. Speed, articulation and dissonance are three examples of such features.</p>

    <p>Please try out the three different sections of this website and then leave feedback in the feedback section.
      The answers in the feedback tab are saved automatically, so you can fill in answers after each section if you wish.

      You don't have to answer all the questions, although the more you answer the more you help!</p>

    <p>This evaluation only uses a set of 98 K-pop (korean pop) songs,
      so you will (probably) not find any songs you recognize.</p>

    <p>The <i>Info</i> tab in the top right contains an explanation of which perceptual features exist and what they mean.
       This information is very helpful when using the Plane and Sliders sections.</p>

    <p>Below is a short description of each of the three available playlist generation tools and how to use them.</p>

    <h3>Emotions</h3>
    <p>This section has a box with four emotions in each corner.
      You can click anywhere within this box to generate a playlist which corresponds to the distance to the four emotions.</p>

    <p>For example, if you click close to the Happy corner, the website will try to generate happy songs.
      If you click between Happy and Aggressive, the website will try to generate songs which are both Happy and
      Aggressive.</p>

    <h3>Plane</h3>
    <p>This page has a box which represents a 2d graph.
      You choose one perceptual feature as the X-axis (the horizontal axis) and one perceptual feature as the Y-axis (the vertical axis).</p>
    <p>You can then click anywhere inside the graph and the website will generate a playlist with songs which match
      your selection.</p>

    <p>
      For example, if you select Speed and Modality, then you can search for fast songs with a minor modality (which should sound fast and dark),
      or slow songs with major modality etc.
    </p>

    <p>You can also choose the size of your selection marker (the circle which appears when you click) by changing the
      variance in the variance slider. The bigger the selection marker, the more songs you can find. </p>

    <h3>Sliders</h3>
    <p>In this page you can freely decide the ranges of any perceptual feature you want by moving the sliders.</p>
    <br>

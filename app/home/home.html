      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello and welcome to this music discovery service. The goal of this website is to evaluate the generation of
        playlists for users by utilizing a special type of features called perceptual features.</p>

      <p>For this prototype, only a set of 98 K-pop (korean pop) songs are used, so you will (probably) not find any
        songs
        you recognize.</p>

      <p>Please try out the three different sections of this website and then leave feedback in the feedback section.
        You don't have to answer all the questions, although the more you answer the more you help!</p>

      <p>Below is a short description of each of the three available playlist generation tools and how to use them.</p>

      <h3>Emotions</h3>
      <p>This page features a square with four emotions in each corner. You can click anywhere within this square to
        generate a playlist which corresponds to the distance to the four emotions.</p>

      <p>For example, if you click close to the Happy corner, the website will try to generate happy songs.
        If you click between Happy and Aggressive, the website will try to generate songs which are both Happy and
        Aggressive.</p>

      <h3>Plane</h3>
      <p>This page features a square which represents a 2d graph. You choose one perceptual feature as the X-axis (the
        horizontal axis) and one perceptual feature as the Y-axis (the vertical axis).</p>
      <p>You can then click anywhere inside the graph and the website will generate a playlist with songs which match
        your
        selection.</p>
      <p>You can also choose the size of your selection marker (the circle which appears when you click) by changing the
        variance in the variance slider.</p>

      <h3>Sliders</h3>
      <p>In this page you can freely decide the ranges of any perceptual feature you want by moving the sliders.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Reference list of the perceptual features</h3>
      <p>Some perceptual features may require musical knowledge to understand, these are listed as complex features.</p>
      <h4>Simple features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Activity (low-high)</b><br>
          The activity of the music.
        </li>
        <li><b>Articulation (legato-staccato)</b><br>
          The duration of tones, measured from legato (longest) to staccato (shortest). See <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQZp2SqHR4I">this youtube video</a> for a quick explanation and
          example of
          staccato and legato.
        </li>
        <li><b>Dissonance (consonant-dissonant)</b><br>
          The dissonance of the music. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Ph0sa0Gc0">this youtube video</a>
          for
          a short demonstration of consonance vs dissonance.
        </li>
        <li><b>Modality (minor-major)</b><br>
          The modality of the song on a continuous scale from minor to major. In general (for western music), a song in
          minor will sound darker or softer than a song in major.
        </li>
        <li><b>Pitch (low-high)</b><br>
          The general pitch height of the music. Pitch is what makes a sound "high" or "low". See <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wIOip2EVow">this youtube video</a> for a short example.
        </li>
        <li><b>Speed (slow-fast)</b><br>
          The speed of the music, based on how fast the music feels.
        </li>
        <li><b>Valence (negative-positive)</b><br>
          The emotion of the song, which ranges from negative to positive. A sad song would have a negative valence, and
          a
          happy song would have a positive valence.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Complex features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Harmonic Complexity (simple-complex)</b><br>
          The complexity of the harmonic progression in the song. This is a rather complex feature which may be
          difficult to
          understand without musical training.
        </li>
        It intends to reflect things like the amount of chords changes or deviations from a key scale structure.
        <li><b>Rhythmic Clarity (flowing-firm)</b><br>
          The amount of rhythmic accentuation of the music.
        </li>
        <li><b>Rhythmic Complexity (simple-complex)</b><br>
          A companion to the rhythmic clarity which measures the complexity of the rhythmic patterns.
        </li>
      </ul>
